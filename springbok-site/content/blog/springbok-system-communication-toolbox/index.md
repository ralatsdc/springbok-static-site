Springbok releases an open source [system communication toolbox](https://github.com/ralatsdc/system-communication-toolbox) for analyzing performance of space services communication networks.

The system communication toolbox performs the engineering analysis required for the coordination of communication networks under national and international regulatory criteria with a focus on the Radiocommunication Sector Space Services.

The system communication toolbox is implemented in MATLAB, and as such, a license for MATLAB is required to use the toolbox. No other toolboxes provided by The Mathworks are, however, required for calculating communication performance, such as equivalent power flux density (EPFD) up, down, and inter-satellite for comparison with Article 22 limits. Test coverage is quite complete.

Give it a try! Or, even better, contribute!
