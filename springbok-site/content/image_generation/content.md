Curious about the images? Springbok created an alphabet inspired by the works of Vasarely to procedurally generate 
images to populate the blog. All images are generated by the first 12 characters in the article's title. The image you 
see above was generated by the phrase "Springbok LL".

We found limiting the generated alphabet to 12 characters created some symmetry and added aesthetics to an otherwise 
chaotic process.
